# meD
The R package `meD` is used to assess causal mediation mechanisms underlying the moderation in the effect of treatment between two different subgroups using the multiply robust estimators incorporating machine learning methods.

Using the R package, a user can decompose a moderated effect of treatment into (i) the mediated moderation through a mediator and (ii) the remaining moderation not through the mediator. For details, please see the accompanying methods paper:
